Project 1 - CS 4348

# Feb. 25 6:30pm

For Project 1, I will implement three Java programs: a logger to record activity, an encryption program using the Vigen√®re cypher, 
and a driver program that manages both using inter-process communication (IPC) with the Process class. My plan is to start 
with the logger, ensuring it logs messages with timestamps, then implement the encryption program to handle encryption and decryption 
with a stored passkey. Finally, I'll develop the driver program to manage user interaction and coordinate communication between processes. 
Challenges include ensuring smooth IPC, correctly implementing the cypher, and handling errors effectively. My next step is setting 
up the Git repository
